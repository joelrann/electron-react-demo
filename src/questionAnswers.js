        Question: <span>The Great Wall of China is visible to the naked eye from the Moon.</span>,
        TrustIt: <span>Seriously?</span>,
        BustIt: <span>Good job!</span>,
        Fact: <span>Knowing that the Moon is 238,855 mi. (384,400 km) from Earth and that the Great Wall of China has a maximum width of 23 ft. (7 m), one can conclude that it is not visible to the naked eye from the Moon. It would be easier to see a hair at a distance of 8 mi. (13 km).</span>,
        Correct: false,

    {
        Question: <span>Lightning never strikes the same spot twice.</span>,
        TrustIt: <span>You should really stay inside.</span>,
        BustIt: <span>Good job!</span>,
        Fact: <span>Lightning is a discharge of electricity that does not care where it strikes. Lightning seeks the shortest path between two clouds or between a cloud and the ground. The same place can, therefore, be struck several times. For example, the Eiffel Tower is struck dozens of times a year.</span>,
        Correct: false,

        Question: <span>An earthworm cut in half does not die, and the two halves will regrow and produce two earthworms.</span>,
        TrustIt: <span>You didn't experiment much as a kid did you?</span>,
        BustIt: <span>Good job!</span>,
        Fact: <span>After being cut, the two halves of the worm squirm. However, the part that does not contain the vital organs dies quickly, while the other part, the one that possesses the vital organs, should survive and even regenerate the missing end.</span>,
        Correct: false,
    },
    {
        Question: <span>At our birth, our brain already has all its neurons.</span>,
        TrustIt: <span>Guess you won't be learning anything new.</span>,
        BustIt: <span>Good job!</span>,
        Fact: <span>Throughout life, the brain creates new neurons. We are not born with all the neurons we will need, as we have long believed.</span>,
        Correct: false,
    },
    {
        Question: <span>A species of mammoths still existed during the construction of the great pyramids of Egypt.</span>,
        TrustIt: <span>Good job!</span>,
        BustIt: <span>Don't worry, this is probably a guess for most people.</span>,
        Fact: <span>Dwarf mammoths on the island of Wrangel (a Russian island in the Arctic Ocean) disappeared around 2000 BC, about 500 years after the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, built about 2500 BC.</span>,
        Correct: true,

    {
        Question: <span>Humans use only 10% of their brains.</span>,
        TrustIt: <span>Maybe you should consider using that remaining 90%.</span>,
        BustIt: <span>Good job!</span>,
        Fact: <span>All humans use much more than 10% of their brains. In fact, all regions of our brain are active, but they are not all active at the same time.</span>,
        Correct: false,
